# GameProjectUnity_demo
## This game was developed during my Master Course at the University of Amsterdam, during Technology 4 Games.
- The game has been developed with Unity2018, and some instable story-line plugins created in lua.
- The game is not finished, but the first levels are playable.
- _Note_: You might experience serveral bugs during gameplay, the provided Unity environment often did not survive a restart of this environment, many things would break by just restarting.
  - This reminds me of the old Windows days, where similar behaviour could be observed.
- Only a mac build is supplied, and the kitten in the game has some potential ....
- The game had a primary goal to pitch and demonstrate your Game format and game potential, with the implemented storyline and game mechanics.
- Thoughtful gamedesign was a leading subject during this very interesting course about games, serious games, fun games, and most recent developments.

- For the very interested reader, the two essays are also included in this repository.

- Have ph√∏n! :-P
